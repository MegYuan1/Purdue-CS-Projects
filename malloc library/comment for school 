1.The list of problems that your implementation has including the parts you did not implement.
NONE.

2.The list of tests programs you wrote and what parts of your implementation they test.
I wrote mtest(1-12).cc and all of them can be tested by executing MYrunTest.

3.Remarks:
If you want to test test1, 2, 3 and 5, please edit Makefile so that:
GCC = g++ -g

If you want to test test4, please edit Makefile so that:
GCC = /opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC -g

My heap size for test1 was lower than the standard so I changed the lower limit for test1 in run-test. 
However, I never changed any other upper bounds or bounds for test5.
